            <h1>Day 2</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>Welcome back! Let's get started: JavaScript is a <b>programming language</b>. But what even is a programming language?</p>
            <p>A programming language is- put simply- a list of instructions executed by a computer. Unless you tell the computer to do otherwise, these instructions will appear to execute in sequence, one after the next. They can do a variety of things, though most of it boils down to manipulating data, inputting data, outputting data, and deciding <i>when</i> to manipulate data.</p>
            <h3>Applications of JavaScript</h3>
            <p>As you probably know by now, JavaScript (JS for short) is mainly used to make web pages interactive. There's even JavaScript on this page! Among other things, it creates that useful navigation section you see on the left, preventing me from having to spend time copying all of the text in the headers over there (and subsequently having to update them all if I want to make any changes).</p>
            <h2>Hello World with console.log</h2>
            <h3>"Hello World"</h3>
            <p>Open up <a href="https://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a> (you now know where the JS is from!) and type the following into the <b>JavaScript</b> tab</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello World!");</code></pre>
            <p>Now find the console in the result tab. You might have to disable and re-enable the "Console in the editor" option to get it to display. The console should appear in the "Result" tab, and should contain the following text upon running the code:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">"Hello World!"</pre>
            <h3>Predict the Output</h3>
            <p><b>Without typing this into JSFiddle</b>, predict what will appear in the console with the following code. Then, confirm your prediction by typing it into JSFiddle.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Goodbye World!"); </code></pre>
            <h3>Predict the Code</h3>
            <p>Now do what's essentially the reverse. Write JavaScript code that produces the following output:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">
"Hello"
"world!"</pre>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
<pre class="noborder"><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello");
console.log("world!");
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <h3>Hello World Revisited</h3>
            <p>Let's change up our "Hello World" code a bit:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let variable = "Hello World";
console.log(variable);</code></pre>
            <p>Type this into JSFiddle, and see what happens. It should output the same thing as the first "Hello World" program. What you've actually done here is create a <b>variable</b>. Let's analyze the first line:</p>
            <pre>
let variable = "Hello World";</pre>
            <p>The <code>let</code> keyword creates, or declares a variable. The text after <code>let</code> is the name of the variable. In the example above, the variable's name is <code>variable</code>, though it could be any string of letters (no spaces though!). Next, we set it equal to the string <code>Hello World</code> with the <code>= "Hello World";</code> part. Remember, every line in JavaScript <i>should</i> end with a semicolon. It will still work without the semicolons, but this can lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
            <p>Now for the second line:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(variable);</code></pre>
            <p>When you write the name of a variable somewhere, it represents the underlying value of the variable. That's why <code>console.log(variable);</code> prints <samp>"Hello World"</samp>, not <samp>variable</samp>. It's just like how in math, you could set a variable <var>x</var> equal to 5. Then, wherever you see <var>x</var>, you can treat it as if it's just the number 5. Speaking of numbers...</p>
            <h3>Numerical Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables can be numbers too!</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let x = 5;
console.log(x);</code></pre>
            <p>As you might have expected, this will print the following to the console:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">5</pre>
            <h2>Math!</h2>
            <p>You can do math on both numbers and variables with numerical values. Consider the following example:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let y = 7;
y = y + 3;
console.log(y);</code></pre>
            <p>Here's the output:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">10</pre>
            <p>Note that using single-letter variable names here is arbitrary. The type of data a variable represents has no influence on the name it can have. Another thing to note is that variables can be assigned and reassigned with the <code>=</code> operator (operators are just symbols that act on pieces of data). Remember to only use <code>let</code> when you define a variable <i>for the first time</i>. You can omit it for all subsequent reassignments of the variable.</p>
            <h3>More Math</h3>
            <p>Here's another one of those "predict the output" games. Guess what the program will output to the console (hint: <code>*</code> is multiplication):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let foo = 5;
let bar = 8;
let baz = foo * bar + 2;
console.log(baz);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Once you've made your guess, type the code into JSFiddle and see if the output matches what you guessed.</p>
            <h3>Math Operators</h3>
            <p>Here is a list of some common math operators:</p>
            <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="bold">Operator</th>
                        <th class="bold">Name</th>
                        <th class="bold">Example Usage</th>
                        <th class="bold">Output</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>+</code></td>
                        <td>Addition</td>
                        <td><code>6 + 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>9</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>-</code></td>
                        <td>Subtraction</td>
                        <td><code>6 - 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>3</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>*</code></td>
                        <td>Multiplication</td>
                        <td><code>6 * 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>18</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>/</code></td>
                        <td>Division</td>
                        <td><code>6 / 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>2</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>%</code></td>
                        <td>Remainder</td>
                        <td><code>6 % 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>0</code></td>
                    </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>Order of Operations (PEMDAS)</h3>
            <p>PEMDAS applies in JavaScript. In other words, statements within parentheses execute first. Without parentheses, multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. The following code outputs <samp>14</samp>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(10 + 8 / 2);</code></pre>
            <p>Conversely, this code outputs <samp>9</samp>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log((10 + 8) / 2);</code></pre>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions are essentially reusable blocks of code. You can create one with the keyword <code>function</code> followed by the name of the function, a pair of parentheses, and finally curly brackets, between which you put the function's code. This is called <b>declaring</b> a function, and the code within the function is the <b>function body</b>. This function below just logs <samp>"Hello World!"</samp> to the console.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>In JavaScript, <b>functions are data</b> and therefore can be assigned to variables. As such, you could also write the above example like this (though the former is still more common):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let helloWorld = function () {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}
            </code></pre>
            <h3>Calling Functions</h3>
            <p>In order to actually run the code within a function, you have to <i>call</i> it. To call a function, type the name of the function, followed by a pair of parentheses. To call the <code>helloWorld</code> function above, you would need to type the following:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
helloWorld();
            </code></pre>
            <p>Remember to include the parentheses. Since functions are data, just typing the function name (<code>helloWorld</code>) refers to the <i>function itself</i>.</p>
            <h3>Function Parameters</h3>
            <p>Data can be "passed" into a function to modify the way it works. In the function declaration, you can put a comma-separated list of names to represent the <b>parameters</b> the function accepts. Consider the following function that converts fahrenheit to celsius:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function fahrenheitToCelsius(degreesInFahrenheit) {
    console.log((degreesInFahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9);
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>This function accepts one parameter, <code>degreesInFahrenheit</code>. Inside the function body, we can treat <code>degreesInFahrenheit</code> like a variable. When calling a parameterized function, we must give actual values to the parameters. We supply these parameters as a comma-separated list within the parentheses in the function call. This example calculates 70 degrees fahrenheit in celsius, and logs it to the console:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
fahrenheitToCelsius(70);
            </code></pre>
            <p>However, we can make this function even better...</p>
            <h3>Return Values</h3>
            <p>Just <code>console.log()</code>ing the degrees in celsius doesn't make much sense- after all, what if we want to do something else with it? We could, of course, use a variable to store the value:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let degreesInCelsius;

function fahrenheitToCelsius(degreesInFahrenheit) {
    degreesInCelsius = (degreesInFahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Avoid doing this if at all possible, because there is actually a much better method of gaining access to the output of a function: <b>return values</b>. When a function "returns" a piece of data, a call to that function acts as if it is that data. A function can return some data by simply putting the keyword <code>return</code> before the data. Let's make the <code>fahrenheitToCelsius</code> function <i>return</i> the temperature in celsius, so we can use it elsewhere:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function fahrenheitToCelsius(degreesInFahrenheit) {
    return (degreesInFahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>We could now, for example, store the output of this function in a variable, and do whatever we want with it:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let seventyInCelsius = fahrenheitToCelsius(70);
let seventyInKelvin = seventyInCelsius + 273.15;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Notice how <code>fahrenheitToCelsius(70)</code> is being treated as a piece of data- this is only possible because of the <code>return</code> statement.</p>
            <p>Note that- when a function encounters a <code>return</code> statement- the function will end prematurely. In addition, functions that don't return anything will return the value <code>undefined</code>, which is another data type you'll see often.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function test() {
    console.log("this code will run!");
    return;
    console.log("but this won't!");
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>The above function will return <code>undefined</code> because there is nothing after the <code>return</code> statement. If there were no <code>return</code> statement at all, it would also return <code>undefined</code>.</p>
            <h2>DRY</h2>
            <p>There is a principle in programming that you will hear me frequently allude to and praise to no end. That is the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY for short), the idea that code should be free of pointless repetition.</p>
            <p>Writing DRY code is important because doing so drastically aids in maintainability. For example, let's say you have several places where you want apply a complex formula to a number. You type out the formula each time. But then the formula turns out to have a mistake in it, and you have to go and change every single copy you just made to fix it. If you had made this formula a function, removing the repitition, you'd only have to fix the mistake once, inside of the function body.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>That's it for Day 2! See you at <a href="day3.html">Day 3</a>, where we'll learn how to compare with booleans, conditional operators, and logical operators; and make decisions with if, else, and else-if statements.</p>
