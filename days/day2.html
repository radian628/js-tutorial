            <h1>Day 2</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>Programming Languages</h3>
            <p>Welcome back! Let's get started: JavaScript is a <b>programming language</b>. But what even is a programming language?</p>
            <p>A programming language is- put simply- a list of instructions executed by a computer. Unless you tell the computer to do otherwise, these instructions will appear to execute in sequence, one after the next. They can do a variety of things, though most of it boils down to manipulating data, inputting data, outputting data, and deciding <i>when</i> to manipulate data.</p>
            <h3>Applications of JavaScript</h3>
            <p>As you probably know by now, JavaScript (JS for short) is mainly used to make web pages interactive. There's even JavaScript on this page! Among other things, it creates that useful navigation section you see on the left, preventing me from having to spend time copying all of the text in the headers over there (and subsequently having to update them all if I want to make any changes).</p>
            <h2>Hello World with console.log</h2>
            <h3>"Hello World"</h3>
            <p>Open up <a href="https://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a> (you now know where the JS is from!) and type the following into the <b>JavaScript</b> tab</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello World!");</code></pre>
            <p>Now find the console in the result tab. You might have to disable and re-enable the "Console in the editor" option to get it to display. The console should appear in the "Result" tab, and should contain the following text upon running the code:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">"Hello World!"</pre>
            <h3>Predict the Output</h3>
            <p><b>Without typing this into JSFiddle</b>, predict what will appear in the console with the following code. Then, confirm your prediction by typing it into JSFiddle.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Goodbye World!"); </code></pre>
            <h3>Predict the Code</h3>
            <p>Now do what's essentially the reverse. Write JavaScript code that produces the following output:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">
"Hello"
"world!"</pre>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
<pre class="noborder"><code class="javascript">console.log("Hello");
console.log("world!");
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <h3>Hello World Revisited</h3>
            <p>Let's change up our "Hello World" code a bit:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let variable = "Hello World";
console.log(variable);</code></pre>
            <p>Type this into JSFiddle, and see what happens. It should output the same thing as the first "Hello World" program. What you've actually done here is create a <b>variable</b>. Let's analyze the first line:</p>
            <pre>
let variable = "Hello World";</pre>
            <p>The <code>let</code> keyword creates, or declares a variable. The text after <code>let</code> is the name of the variable. In the example above, the variable's name is <code>variable</code>, though it could be any string of letters (no spaces though!). Next, we set it equal to the string <code>Hello World</code> with the <code>= "Hello World";</code> part. Remember, every line in JavaScript <i>should</i> end with a semicolon. It will still work without the semicolons, but this can lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
            <p>Now for the second line:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(variable);</code></pre>
            <p>When you write the name of a variable somewhere, it represents the underlying value of the variable. That's why <code>console.log(variable);</code> prints <samp>"Hello World"</samp>, not <samp>variable</samp>. It's just like how in math, you could set a variable <var>x</var> equal to 5. Then, wherever you see <var>x</var>, you can treat it as if it's just the number 5. Speaking of numbers...</p>
            <h3>Numerical Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables can be numbers too!</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let x = 5;
console.log(x);</code></pre>
            <p>As you might have expected, this will print the following to the console:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">5</pre>
            <h2>Math!</h2>
            <p>You can do math on both numbers and variables with numerical values. Consider the following example:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let y = 7;
y = y + 3;
console.log(y);</code></pre>
            <p>Here's the output:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">10</pre>
            <p>Note that using single-letter variable names here is arbitrary. The type of data a variable represents has no influence on the name it can have. Another thing to note is that variables can be assigned and reassigned with the <code>=</code> operator (operators are just symbols that act on pieces of data). Remember to only use <code>let</code> when you define a variable <i>for the first time</i>. You can omit it for all subsequent reassignments of the variable.</p>
            <h3>More Math</h3>
            <p>Here's another one of those "predict the output" games. Guess what the program will output to the console (hint: <code>*</code> is multiplication):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let foo = 5;
let bar = 8;
let baz = foo * bar + 2;
console.log(baz);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Once you've made your guess, type the code into JSFiddle and see if the output matches what you guessed.</p>
            <h3>Math Operators</h3>
            <p>Here is a list of some common math operators:</p>
            <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="bold">Operator</th>
                        <th class="bold">Name</th>
                        <th class="bold">Example Usage</th>
                        <th class="bold">Output</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>+</code></td>
                        <td>Addition</td>
                        <td><code>6 + 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>9</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>-</code></td>
                        <td>Subtraction</td>
                        <td><code>6 - 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>3</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>*</code></td>
                        <td>Multiplication</td>
                        <td><code>6 * 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>18</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>/</code></td>
                        <td>Division</td>
                        <td><code>6 / 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>2</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>%</code></td>
                        <td>Remainder</td>
                        <td><code>6 % 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>0</code></td>
                    </tr>
            </table>
            <h3>Order of Operations (PEMDAS)</h3>
            <p>PEMDAS applies in JavaScript. In other words, statements within parentheses execute first. Without parentheses, multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction. The following code outputs <samp>14</samp>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log(10 + 8 / 2);</code></pre>
            <p>Conversely, this code outputs <samp>9</samp>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">console.log((10 + 8) / 2);</code></pre>
            <h2>Booleans</h2>
            <h3>What are Booleans?</h3>
            <p>Booleans are another data type in JavaScript (a <b>data type</b> is a distinct form that data (i.e. variables) can take). Booleans can only take one of two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let boolean = true;
let anotherBoolean = false;</code></pre>
            <h3>Booleans from Comparison Operators</h3>
            <p>Comparison operators are operators that- as you might expect- compare the size of two numbers. They output booleans- <code>true</code> if the comparison is accurate, and <code>false</code> if it is not. As an example, <code>6 &gt; 2</code> is <code>true</code> (because six is, in fact, greater than two), whereas <code>5 &lt; 4</code> is <code>false</code> (because five is not less than four).</p>
            <h3>Comparison Operator Table</h3>
            <p>This might look a bit intimidating. However, if you're well-versed with comparison from your math class, you'll likely only need to consider the leftmost two rows (the others are just examples).</p>
            <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th class="bold">Operator</th>
                        <th class="bold">Name</th>
                        <th class="bold">Example 1</th>

                        <td><code>true</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>&lt;=</code></td>
                        <td>Less Than or Equal To</td>
                        <td><code>6 &lt;= 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>false</code></td>
                        <td><code>4 &lt;= 4</code></td>
                        <td><code>true</code></td>

                        <td><code>4 == 4</code></td>
                        <td><code>true</code></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><code>!=</code></td>
                        <td>Not Equal</td>
                        <td><code>6 != 3</code></td>
                        <td><code>true</code></td>
                        <td><code>4 != 4</code></td>
                        <td><code>false</code></td>
                    </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Warning: <b>Do not confuse <code>==</code> (equals) with <code>=</code> (assignment).</b> The former tests whether two things are equal (outputting <code>true</code> if they are, and <code>false</code> otherwise), while the latter sets the variable on the left to the value on the right.</p>
            <h2>If-Statements</h2>
            <p>If-statements allow you to run code conditionally- in other words, they only run the code within them <b>if</b> a given boolean is <code>true</code>. For example, the code below only prints <samp>"x is greater than 7!"</samp> if the variable <code>x</code> is greater than 7.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let x = 10;
if (x > 7) {
    console.log("x is greater than 7!");
}
x = 5;
if (x > 7) {
    console.log("x is greater than 7!");
}</code></pre>
            <p>The way the code is currently structured, how many times will it output <samp>"x is greater than 7!"</samp>? Which if-statement(s) will run?</p>
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <p>Once. Only the first if-statement will execute the code between its curly braces.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Else</h3>
            <p>Take the following example:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain = 0.75;
if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.5) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
}
if (chanceOfRain &lt;= 0.5) {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
}</code></pre>
            <p>You may quickly realize that the second if-statement will only run if the first one doesn't. After all, the first one uses a "greater than" condition, whereas the second uses a "less than or equal to" condition- both with the same operands (operands is a term for what operators operate on)! The <code>else</code> keyword can simplify this code- it lets you provide a block of code that will only run if the preceding if-statement does not.</p>
            <p>The following example functions identically to the previous one, but uses an <code>else</code> block instead of another if-statement. To use <code>else</code>, first type the word <code>else</code>, followed by curly brackets, in which you'll put your code. Unlike the if-statement, you don't need parentheses.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain = 0.75;
if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.5) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
}</code></pre>
            <p>Side note: Changing the structure of code while keeping the same functionality (which is what we did here) is called <b>refactoring</b>.</p>
            <h3>Else If</h3>
            <p>Multiple if-statements can be chained together using <code>else if</code>. <code>else if</code> functions identically to <code>else</code>, except the code after the <code>else if</code> only runs if the supplied condition is true. Multiple <code>else if</code>s can even be chained together, each one only executing if all the previous ones have not.</p> 
            <p>To use <code>else if</code>, just type <code>else</code> followed by an if-statement just like you'd write it on your own.</p>
            <p>Consider the following example, which does exactly what you might expect:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain = 0.2;
if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.8) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.3) {
    console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
}</code></pre>
            <p>Given the above code, what is the likelihood of rain? Check your answer by typing the example into JSFiddle.</p>
            <h3>Another Example of Else-if</h3>
            <p>Edit the previous example so that it prints <samp>"It's definitely not going to rain!"</samp> if the chance of rain is exactly 0. Test your code with different values for <code>chanceOfRain</code> to see if it works! Note that your solution might look different but still work. There are multiple solutions to essentially every non-trivial problem in JavaScript!</p>
            <p>Possible solution:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain = 0.2;
if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.8) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.3) {
    console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain != 0) {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It's definitely not going to rain!");
}</code></pre>
            </div>
            <h2>Functions</h2>
            <p>Let's say we have to check the chance of rain three different times, using the previous code we wrote. Let's represent the three chances we're interested in using variables:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain1 = 0;
let chanceOfRain2 = 0.5;
let chanceOfRain3 = 0.9;</code></pre>
            <p>We could, of course, do it like this:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">let chanceOfRain1 = 0;
let chanceOfRain2 = 0.5;
let chanceOfRain3 = 0.9;

if (chanceOfRain1 &gt; 0.8) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain1 &gt; 0.3) {
    console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain1 != 0) {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It's definitely not going to rain!");
}

if (chanceOfRain2 &gt; 0.8) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain2 &gt; 0.3) {
    console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain2 != 0) {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It's definitely not going to rain!");
}

if (chanceOfRain3 &gt; 0.8) {
    console.log("It is likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain3 &gt; 0.3) {
    console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
} else if (chanceOfRain3 != 0) {
    console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
} else {
    console.log("It's definitely not going to rain!");
}</code></pre>
            <p>However, as you can probably see, this is horribly repetitive. Imagine if you wanted to add a condition that says <samp>"It will certaintly rain!"</samp> if the chance of rain is 1? You'd have to do that three times!</p>
            <p>Because of this (along with their general laziness), programmers <i>hate</i> needless repetition, and thus, they've developed tools to combat it. In fact, if any of your code is extremely repetitive, you should seek out a better way, because a disgruntled programmer has likely already thought of one, and added it to the language.</p>
            <p>Often the best way of eliminating repetition is using <b>functions</b>. A function is simply a named block of code that you can run as many times as you want. They are created with the keyword <code>function</code>, followed by the function name (which works the same as a variable name), after which you put parentheses, and finally curly brackets in which you put your code. Here's a function that simply writes <samp>"Hello World!"</samp> to the console:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}</code></pre>
            <p>Between the parentheses, you can optionally put a list of <b>function arguments</b>. These are just a bunch of pieces of data that you "pass" or "plug" into the function, influencing its behavior. In math class, if you've seen something like <var>f(x)</var>, the function argument is basically the <var>x</var>.</p>
            <p>To actually run the function, type the name of the function, followed by a set of parentheses. Between the parentheses, put the values you want the arguments to take. Even if there are no arguments, you should still include the parentheses! In JavaScript, <b>functions are just another type of data</b> (you'll hear me repeat this a lot), so just writing the function name merely refers to the function itself!</p>
            <p>Here's the previous example, refactored to use a function:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">function describeChanceOfRain(chanceOfRain) {
    if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.8) {
        console.log("It is likely to rain.");
    } else if (chanceOfRain &gt; 0.3) {
        console.log("It is somewhat likely to rain.");
    } else if (chanceOfRain != 0) {
        console.log("It is unlikely to rain.");
    } else {
        console.log("It's definitely not going to rain!");
    }
}

let chanceOfRain1 = 0;
let chanceOfRain2 = 0.5;
let chanceOfRain3 = 0.9;

describeChanceOfRain(chanceOfRain1);
describeChanceOfRain(chanceOfRain2);
describeChanceOfRain(chanceOfRain3);</code></pre>
            <p>Props to you if you figured this out already, but our good old friend <code>console.log</code> is a function too!</p>
            <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
            <p>Here's an assignment to test your skills: Create a function <code>fizzBuzz(x)</code> that abides by the following rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If <code>x</code> is divisible by 3, print <samp>"Fizz"</samp> to the console.</li>
                <li>If <code>x</code> is divisible by 5, print <samp>"Buzz"</samp> to the console.</li>
                <li>If <code>x</code> is divisible by both 3 and 5, print <samp>"FizzBuzz"</samp> (and only <samp>"FizzBuzz"</samp>) to the console.</li>
                <li>If none of the previous three conditions apply, print the value of <code>x</code> to the console.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's a table showing what values x should output (make it work for any positive integer however- not just these!):</p>
            <table>
                <tr>

            <h2>Challenge: N Hello Worlds</h2>
            <p>Here's a fun challenge: Create a function <code>helloWorlds</code> that prints <samp>Hello World!</samp> <code>n</code> times, where <code>n</code> is one of its arguments. So, for example, <code>helloWorlds(4);</code> would print the following:</p>
            <pre class="js-output">
"Hello World!"
"Hello World!"
"Hello World!"
"Hello World!"</pre>
            <p>Stuck? Here's a hint:</p>

                <input type="checkbox">
                <p>Hint: <code>helloWorlds</code> should <i>call itself.</i></p>
