            <h1>Day 4</h1>
            
            <h2>Objects</h2>
            <h3>What are Objects?</h3>
            <p>The idea of an <i>object</i> may just be the most important concept in JavaScript. Objects are- put simply- a bunch of variables "within" another variable. They are made up of a list of <b>keys</b>, strings that act as labels; and <b>values</b>, pieces of data attached to the keys. A key and its corresponding value together is called an <b>entry</b>, a <b>property</b>, or a <b>key-value pair</b>. Yes, these three names do, in fact, refer to the same thing.</p>
            <h3>Creating Objects</h3>
            <p>Consider the following data, which describe a product at a grocery store- potato chips- of which the store has 123 bags- that sell for $1.25:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Key</th>
                    <th>Value</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Name</td>
                    <td>Potato Chips</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Price</td>
                    <td>1.25</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Quantity In Stock</td>
                    <td>123</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>As you can see, these data form a "key-value" relationship (and yes, "data" is plural). They can be turned into a JavaScript object like so:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let product = {
    name: "Potato Chips",
    price: 1.25,
    quantityInStock: 123
};
            </code></pre>
            <p>As you can see, objects are assigned to variables using <code>let</code>, just like many of the other data types. They are surrounded by curly brackets. Between the curly brackets, entries are separated with commas, and keys are separated from their values with colons.</p>
            <p>Be aware of the naming conventions of keys. Keys generally have no spaces in their names. Every word but the first should be capitalized. This also applies to JavaScript functions and variables.</p>
            <h3>Accessing Properties</h3>
            <p>The value of an object's property can be accessed by typing in the name of the object, followed by a <code>.</code> (period), and then the name of that property's key. For instance, <code>product.name</code> is <samp>"Potato Chips"</samp>.</p>
            <p>You can also change and add properties to an object. Let's say the store wants to open a new branch in the UK, where they call chips "crisps". We could use the following line of code to update the name.</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
product.name = "Potato Crisps";
            </code></pre>
            <p>We can also add new properties by simply setting a property that doesn't exist yet. Let's say the store wants to indicate that the chips are on sale. They could do that as follows:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
product.onSale = true;
            </code></pre>
            <p>The <code>onSale</code> property never existed before, but it does now!</p>
            <h3>What is console.log?</h3>
            <p>All that being said, what is <code>console</code>? What is <code>log</code>? And what is <code>console.log</code>?</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>console</code> is an object.</li>
                        <li><code>log</code> is the name of one of <code>console</code>'s keys.</li>
                        <li><code>console.log</code> represents the value that corresponds to the <code>log</code> key. It might seem odd that this value is a function, but remember, functions are data!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>HTML-JavaScript Interaction</h2>
            <h3>document.getElementById</h3>
            <p>With all of this explained, we can combine HTML and JavaScript together... sort of. Consider the following HTML and JavaScript in their respective tabs:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p id="paragraph"&gt;JavaScript will change this text!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let paragraph = document.getElementById("paragraph");
paragraph.innerText = "new text";
            </code></pre>
            <p>This new function <code>document.getElementById</code> returns a JavaScript object representing an HTML element. More specifically, the JavaScript object represents an HTML element with the <code>id</code> attribute specified by its first argument. In the above example, we're getting the element with the id <code>paragraph</code>, which the <code>p</code> element in the body has. You can think of it like asking "hey, can you get me information about the element with the ID <code>"paragraph"</code>?"</p>
            <p>In the second line, we change the value of the element's <code>innerText</code> property to <code>"new text"</code>. The <code>innerText</code> property represents the text inside of an HTML element, and- when changed- the HTML element matches to update it. As such, all of this code together makes the HTML display the following:</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <p>new text</p>
            </div>
            <p>We can also read these properties just like any other property of a JavaScript object. So if we added <code>console.log(paragraph.innerText)</code> after our current code, the program would then output <samp>"new text"</samp> to the console.</p>
            <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
            <p>We had JavaScript control HTML in the last section. Now let's do the reverse with event listeners! Event listeners are simply functions that the browser calls whenever some event happens- for example if an element is clicked, the user scrolls the mouse, or a key is pressed. Here is an example:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;button id="click-me-button"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function clickHandler() {
    console.log("clicked!");
}

let button = document.getElementById("click-me-button");
button.onclick = clickHandler;
            </code></pre>
            <p>The HTML is standard stuff- a button with an id of <code>click-me-button</code>. The JavaScript starts with a function declaration that simply logs <samp>"clicked!"</samp> to the console. Then, we get the button with <code>document.getElementById</code> (notice, again, how the parameter to <code>document.getElementById</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute of the element are identical). Finally, we set the button's <code>onclick</code> property to the function. The browser knows to run the <code>onclick</code> function (if it exists) whenever the element is clicked, so clicking the button will now log <samp>"clicked!"</samp> to the console, because it runs <code>clickHandler</code>. Remember not to include parentheses after the function in this case, because we are referring to <i>the function itself</i>, not its return value (if any).</p>
            <p>Note that the JavaScript can also be written like this to set <code>button.onclick</code> directly to the function without an intermediary. Also note the lack of a function name:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let button = document.getElementById("click-me-button");

button.onclick = function() {
    console.log("clicked!");
}
            </code></pre>
            <h2>Click Counter</h2>
            <p>Here's a test of your skills: Have HTML that shows text and a button. Have the text display how many times the button has been clicked.</p>
            <h2>Input Elements</h2>
            <h3>Inputs and the "Value" Attribute</h3>
            <p><code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements are among the most important of HTML elements. They allow the user to supply text, numbers, files, colors, and much more, data that can all be accessed from JavaScript.</p>
            <p>As you might remember, <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>s have a <code>value</code> attribute containing whatever data has been supplied to them. This same data can be accessed from JavaScript with a property of the same name.</p>
            <h3>The "Change" Event</h3>
            <p>The <code>change</code> event is fired from an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element when the user exits its editable region after making a change to its <code>value</code>. The corresponding property for the <code>change</code> event is <code>onchange</code> (just like <code>onclick</code> for the <code>click</code> event). Remember that, in general, the property name will have "on" before the event name.</p>
            <p>Type the following into JSFiddle, run it, and see what happens when you type into the text box:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;input value="change my text!" id="input"&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let input = document.getElementById("input");
input.onchange = function () {
    console.log(input.value);
}
            </code></pre>
            <h3>The "Input" Event</h3>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let input = document.getElementById("input");
input.oninput = function () {
    console.log(input.value);
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Now change the <code>onchange</code> to <code>oninput</code> (as shown above), re-run the program, and try typing again. Notice the difference in what appears in the console? The <code>input</code> event is triggered every time a character is entered.</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>With the skills you've learned so far, you could (and- to reinforce these skills- probably <i>should</i>) make a four-function calculator! When you're ready, go <a href="day5.html">here</a> for Day 5!</p>
