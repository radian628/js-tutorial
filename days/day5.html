            <h1>Day 5</h1>
            <h2>HTML5 Canvas API</h2>
            <p>Okay, this is where things get interesting. The HTML5 Canvas API is basically an image editor you control with code. You can draw rectangles, lines, circles, images, text, and a whole lot of other stuff. That might seem simple and rather boring, but combine some of those elements together and you can achieve amazing results. But first...</p>
            <h3>What is an "API" anyway?</h3>
            <p>"API" is an acronym for <b>Application Programming Interface</b>. It's basically any way of controlling <i>something</i> with code. That description is vague for a reason. Compare it to a GUI (graphical user interface), which I'm sure you're familiar with. GUIs let you control things with buttons, dials, inputs, and all those other interactive visual elements. An API is like a GUI, except all the, buttons and dials and whatnot are replaced with code. Interestingly, virtually all GUIs just control an API under-the-hood.</p>
            <p>And funnily enough, you've already been working with APIs. <code>console.log</code>? That's the console API. <code>document.getElementById</code>? That's part of the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) API. And now you're going to learn about the canvas API.</p>
            <h3>The Canvas API</h3>
            <p>So now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's get back to the canvas API, which is- again- essentially an image editor you control with code. First, we need to set up the canvas element itself, like so:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="512" height="512"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here we have two new attributes, the <code>width</code> and the <code>height</code> attribute. These describe the width and the height of the canvas <i>in pixels</i>. It's important to note that while by default, these correspond to the actual size of the canvas <i>as it appears on the screen</i>, CSS can allow the apparent size to differ. However, the actual size of the underlying image, in terms of pixels, will <i>always</i> be determined by the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes.</p>
            <p>With all that out of the way, we can start work on the JavaScript:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
            </code></pre>
            <p>First line we've done many times before- getting an HTML element with <code>document.getElementById</code>. The second line is something new. HTML canvas element objects have a special function called <code>getContext</code> that returns a <i>canvas context</i>. A canvas context is a different object whose properties consist of many of the functions (among other things) that allow you to draw on a canvas.</p> 
            <h3>The First Square</h3>   
            <p>Let's start out by drawing a square. Change the JavaScript to the following (first two lines are the same):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 25, 25);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here's what the result should look like:</p>
            <canvas id="canvas1" width="512" height="512"></canvas>
            <script>
                let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas1");
                let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
                ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 25, 25);
            </script>
            <h4>Canvas Coordinate System</h4>
            <p>The <code>fillRect</code> function of the canvas context- as you might expect- draws a filled rectangle. However, it's important to note what each of its four parameters do. To do this, we need to understand the coordinate system that the canvas uses. Firstly, all units are generally pixels. Secondly, and most importantly, I'd say, the origin is defined as the top-left corner. The positive x-direction is towards the right (as you might expect), but- strangely- the positive y-direction is <i>downward</i>. Here's an illustration that demonstrates this coordinate system on a 512-by-512-pixel canvas (this is by no means the <i>only</i> resolution you can use, however):</p>
            <img src="canvas-coordinate-system.png">
            <p>Now this might seem strange and unintuitive to you. <i>Why in the world do Y-values increase as you go down?</i> However, in the context of web pages, it makes a whole lot more sense. Web pages, after all, always start scrolled to the top. The top of the page is the default and the beginning- in other words, the origin. This is even reflected by one of the primary purposes of websites: reading textual articles (like you're doing here!). In English at least, text starts at the top and goes down, <i>just like the canvas coordinate system</i>. This also allows the canvas coordinate system to be consistent- you'll eventually find that position-related properties of HTML elements use the same coordinate system.</p>
            <h4>Okay, back to the square.</h4>
            <p>Let's return to the square. As a reminder, here's our HTML and JavaScript:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;canvas id="canvas" width="512" height="512"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
            </code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 25, 25);
            </code></pre>
            <p>The first two parameters describe the coordinates of the top-left corner of the square. The last two describe the square's width and height. Here's an illustration that shows how each parameter works:</p>
            <img src="fillrect-explained.png">
            <p>Keep in mind that other canvas drawing functions won't have documentation to this level of detail, so remember to learn to experiment with them if the documentation you <i>do</i> get is insufficient. In fact, this is often true for APIs in general.</p>
            <h3>More fillRect</h3>
            <h4>Covering the Canvas</h4>
            <p>Given that the canvas is 512 by 512 pixels, change the JavaScript to draw a rectangle that covers the whole canvas (and nothing more). Solution is below:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 512, 512);
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            <h4>Drawing Rectangles</h4>
            <p>How would you use <code>ctx.fillRect</code> to draw the following rectangles? Read these examples very carefully.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A rectangle 50 pixels from the left of the canvas, 30 pixels from the top of the canvas, 100 pixels wide, and 150 pixels tall.</li>
                <li>A square centered at the point 100 pixels from the left of the canvas and 125 pixels from the top of the canvas. It should have a side length of 50 pixels.</li>
                <li>A square 100 pixels from the right of the canvas and 50 pixels from the bottom of the canvas. It should have a side length of 30 pixels. This should work regardless of the canvas size.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Assume that the following code is already present for all examples:</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
            </code></pre>
            <p>Note that you can use the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties of the canvas element object (the one returned by <code>document.getElementById</code>) to find the size of the canvas in pixels. Remember that, since these are properties, you'll need to prefix them with the name of the canvas element object (in this case, that is the variable <var>canvas</var>.</p>           
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
                    <p>Rectangle 1</p>
                    <pre><code class="javascript">
    ctx.fillRect(50, 30, 100, 150);
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Rectangle 2</p>
                    <pre><code class="javascript">
    ctx.fillRect(75, 100, 50, 50);
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Rectangle 3</p>
                    <pre><code class="javascript">
    ctx.fillRect(canvas.width - 130, canvas.height - 80, 30, 30);
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Paths</h3>
            <p>Rectangles are far from the only thing you can make with the canvas. Another thing you can create is paths. Paths are simply a series of points. After this series of points is specified, you can draw things based on the points. The most common examples consist of using the points to draw a line that connects from point to point in order (called a stroke), or treating the set of points as vertices of a polygon, and filling the interior of that polygon (called a fill). Let's take a look at an example (assume that our HTML is the same as what it was at the beginning):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

ctx.beginPath();
ctx.moveTo(100, 100);
ctx.lineTo(150, 50);
ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
ctx.closePath();
ctx.stroke();
            </code></pre>
            <p>Here's what the above code generates (albeit with a smaller canvas so it takes up less space in the page):</p>
            <canvas id="canvas3" width="256" height="128"></canvas>
            <script>
            {
                let canvas = document.getElementById("canvas3");
                let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.moveTo(100, 100);
                ctx.lineTo(150, 50);
                ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
                ctx.closePath();
                ctx.stroke();
            }
            </script>
            <p>Let's analyze what's going on here. We've already seen the first two lines (getting the canvas and canvas context). However, the next six lines are new. <code>ctx.beginPath</code> indicates that we are creating a path. This is important to include, especially if we are creating multiple paths, because without it, every path we make will be assumed to be one single huge path.</p>
            <p>The next new function, <code>ctx.moveTo</code>, indicates that a path should be started at the specified coordinates. So, in this case, we're starting a path at the point 100 pixels from the top of the cavnas and 100 pixels from the left of the canvas.</p>
            <p>The next function, <code>ctx.lineTo</code>, adds a point, and indicates that a line should be drawn from the previous point to the point specified by its parameters. So the first call is basically saying "draw a line from (100, 100) to (150, 50)" and the second call is saying "draw a line from (150, 50) to (200, 100)". Notice how I never said that <code>ctx.lineTo</code> actually draws the line. You'll see why shortly.</p>
            <p>Now we have <code>ctx.closePath</code>. This essentially says to connect the last point to the first point. Without this, only two lines would be drawn- the one connecting (100, 100) and (150, 50); and the one connecting (150, 50) and (200, 100).</p>
            <p>Finally, we have <code>ctx.stroke</code>, the function that actually draws the lines. The five lines before this essentially consisted of giving <code>ctx.stroke</code> a blueprint for what to draw.</p>
            <h3>What can you do with the canvas?</h3>
            <p>Much of what I've covered here might seem really simple. However, by leveraging JavaScript's ability to simplify annoying repetition, we can do some amazing things with programming that would take much longer in a traditional program. Consider the following example:</p>
            <canvas id="canvas4" width="512" height="512"></canvas>
            <script>
            {let c = document.getElementById("canvas4");
            let ctx = c.getContext("2d");

            function iteration(x, y, size, remaining) {
                let halfSize = size / 2;
                ctx.fillRect(x - halfSize, y - halfSize, size, size);
                if (remaining > 0) {
                    iteration(x - halfSize, y - halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
                    iteration(x + halfSize, y - halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
                    iteration(x - halfSize, y + halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
                    iteration(x + halfSize, y + halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
                }
            }

            iteration(256, 256, 256, 7);
            }
            </script>
            <p>Here is the code (again, HTML is the same as the example at the beginning):</p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
let c = document.getElementById("canvas");
let ctx = c.getContext("2d");

function iteration(x, y, size, remaining) {
    let halfSize = size / 2;
    ctx.fillRect(x - halfSize, y - halfSize, size, size);
    if (remaining > 0) {
        iteration(x - halfSize, y - halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
        iteration(x + halfSize, y - halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
        iteration(x - halfSize, y + halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
        iteration(x + halfSize, y + halfSize, halfSize, remaining - 1);
    }
}

iteration(256, 256, 256, 7);
            </code></pre>
            <p>Let's analyze how this works. We should first figure out the process for creating such an image in the first place before we analyze the code. Breaking a process down into pieces is important for translating that process in code, because, if we break it down enough, we'll be able to implement that process one-to-one. Anyway' let's get started:</p>
            <p>We can start with the large square in the center. Centered on each corner of this square is another square with half the side length of the original. If we look at just one of these smaller squares, we see the same thing: centered on each corner of the half-sized square, there is another square half its size. And if we look at <i>those</i> squares, we find even smaller ones centered at its corners. And so on.</p> 
            <p>Now for the code. First two lines are standard stuff (defining canvas and context). Then, we have the function <code>iteration</code>, which makes up the bulk of this program. It accepts four parameters: a position (in the form of x and y coordinates), a size, and a parameter representing the remaining number of iterations.</p>
            <p>Let's start with the first two lines in the function. The first one creates a variable to represent half of the size. I could have just typed <code>size / 2</code> a bunch of times. However, I think assigning it to a new variable is cleaner. The line after that, <code>ctx.fillRect(x - halfSize, y - halfSize, size, size);</code> draws a square with side length <code>size</code>, centered at (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>). Since the first two parameters of <code>ctx.fillRect</code> represent the top-left corner, we have to subtract half of the side length to center the square.</p>
            <p>Now let's look at the if-statement and the code inside of it, which are arguably the most important parts of this code. The code inside the if-statement calls <code>iteration</code> four times. Consider what we plug in for the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> parameters in these calls to <code>iteration</code>. Notice how the first one is the same as the two parameters for <code>ctx.fillRect</code> above- in other words, the top-right corner of the square we just drew. In fact, if you think about it, the values we're plugging in for<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for all of these four calls to <code>iteration</code> are the corners of the square we just drew. And since <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> represent the center of the square, those four calls to <code>iteration</code> are drawing squares centered at the corners of the larger square, just like how we described the process for generating this thing in the first place. And it gets better: these squares are half the size, because we're plugging in <code>halfSize</code> for the <code>size</code> parameter. This is exactly what we described in the first paragraph of this section.</p>
            <p>Of course, you may notice a problem with this: if we keep having this function call itself, it'll do it forever. This is what the <code>remaining</code> argument is for. Every time we go another layer deep, it decreases by 1. When it hits zero, no more additional calls to <code>iteration</code> are made.</p>
            <p>And then, finally, at the end of the code, we have to call <code>iteration</code> in the first place. In this case, we're centering the big square at (256, 256), with a side length of 256 pixels, and we plan to go 7 layers deep.</p>
            <h3>Additional Canvas Features</h3>
            <p>Here's some additional canvas features to play around with. I won't go in-depth into documenting these- it's your job to figure out exactly how they work. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D">Here's a good resource for canvas API features- in fact, it basically contains <i>all</i> of them.</a> Remember that all of these are the names of <i>properties</i>, so they need to be prefixed with whatever your canvas context is called.</p>
            <h4>Canvas Methods/Functions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>arc</code> - A function used in paths similar to lineTo. However, this one draws a portion of a circle (an arc), rather than a line.</li>
                <li><code>fill</code> - The filling counterpart to <code>stroke</code>. This function takes whatever path you specified and fills its interior. </li>
                <li><code>fillText</code> and <code>strokeText</code> - Functions for drawing text on the canvas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Canvas Properties</h4>
            <p>Set these (with <code>=</code>) to get different effects</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>strokeStyle</code> - Sets color of all future strokes/lines. Does not effect previously-drawn ones.</li>
                <li><code>fillStyle</code> - Fill equivalent to <code>strokeStyle</code>.</li>
                <li><code>lineWidth</code> - Determines width of stroke lines in pixels.</li>
                <li><code>font</code> - Sets font of all text drawn on canvas. This one is annoying to format, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work on your first try.</li>
            </ul>
