            <h2>A Word of Advice</h2>
            <p>Before I start, I just want to give some advice: When reading over tutorials (such as this one), if you want to absorb all the information, <b>you should read <i>every</i> word</b>. Don't try to skim or skip over any words or sentences- you could easily gloss over a sentence that completely reframes your understanding. This also applies if you're only reading a single section- read <i>all</i> of that section! So if you find yourself stumped with some part of this tutorial (or one of the next ones), ask yourself this: <i>Did I read <b>everything?</b></i> If the answer is "no," read over everything again, this time sparing no details!</p>
            <p>While this advice might seem obvious to some, I think it's important to mention <b>and be conscious of</b>, because it's a trap that <b>anyone</b> can fall into without even realizing- especially if they're tired and wanting to get things over with. I still occasionally get lazy and start skimming over programming tutorials... and I've been programming for six years!</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
            <p>HTML is a <b>markup</b> language (not a programming language!) that describes the content of web pages. It tells the browser that what you're reading right now is a paragraph of text, and that the text above this paragraph is a header. It can describe all sorts of elements: Paragraphs, headers, lists, images, buttons, inputs, and even videos, to name a few.</p>
            <p>An important distinction to make with HTML is that HTML describes <i>what</i> is on a page, not <i>how it looks.</i> It will tell you that there's two paragraphs of text. However, it won't tell you how big the font is, how wide the paragraphs are, whether they're separated, et cetera. Sure, the browser creates a default look, but this should not be relied on if you're going for a specific style! Determining how a page looks is the job of CSS (which is another topic entirely).</p>
            <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language- in other words, a series of human-readable instructions that can be read and executed by a computer. JavaScript's primary purpose is adding interactivity to websites. Virtually every website you visit contains JavaScript <i>somewhere</i>. When you press a button, move your mouse, scroll, or even just sit idley on a page, there is JavaScript running, reacting to your every move.</p>
            <h2>Coding with JSFiddle</h2>
            <p>JSFiddle is an online code editor that lets you edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all while showing you the result of what you've made. <a href="https://jsfiddle.net">Try it out here!</a></p>
            <p>There are four main tabs by default. They all do what you might expect- "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript" contain their respective languages, while "Result" contains the result of what you created in the other three. You can find options for running and saving fiddles near the top left corner, and you can find options near the top right. <b>If you save a fiddle, copy the URL somewhere! That's how you can access it again!</b></p>
            <h2>Useful Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
            <p>Before we begin, here are some useful keyboard shortcuts you should get acquainted with.</p>
            <p>Note: Replace all <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>s with <kbd>Command</kbd>s on MacOS!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> stores everything you've highlighted in the <b>clipboard</b>. Basically, your computer "remembers" everything you highlighted (other keyboard shortcuts let you do things with it). This operation is called "copy".</li>
                <li><kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> inserts the contents of the clipboard onto wherever you're typing. This operation is called "paste". <b>With <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, you can choose what you want to copy, and with <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>, you can put it somewhere else!</b></li>
                <li><kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> deletes everything you've highlighted, and puts it in the clipboard. This operation is called "cut", and is useful if you want to move something around.</li>
                <li><kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> selects everything.</li>
                <li><b><kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> saves whatever you're editing.</b> I do this basically every 10 seconds (you should too!).</li>
                <li>When editing text, <kbd>Arrow Key</kbd> (works with all arrow keys) moves the text cursor (AKA a caret- the flashing line that shows where your text goes) in the specified direction
                    <ul>
                        <li><kbd>Shift+Arrow Key</kbd> is identical to <kbd>Arrow Key</kbd>, but also highlights the portion of text that was "moved over".</li>
                        <li><kbd>Ctrl+Arrow Key</kbd> is identical to <kbd>Arrow Key</kbd>, but skips entire words (PC) or entire lines (MAC) rather than letters when the arrow key is pressed.</li>
                        <li><kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Arrow Key</kbd> combines the two- you can jump through large blocks of text <i>and</i> select it all at once!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><kbd>Tab</kbd>, in many code editors, will indent the lines of code you have selected, rather than simply replacing your selection with a TAB character. This is useful for indenting large sections of code.</li>
                <li><kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> unindents the lines of code you have selected. It essentially reverses what <kbd>Tab</kbd> does.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>A word of warning on <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd></h3>
            <p>You might be tempted to use <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to copy some of the examples below into JSFiddle. Resist this temptation! You'll almost certainly learn more effectively by typing out the examples letter-by-letter, even if you're just copying from here. Typing things out will help you memorize the fundamentals of HTML (and eventually JavaScript) more effectively, preventing you from getting bogged down and/or forgetting syntax.</p>
            <h2>Intro to HTML</h2>
            <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
            <p>This is an HTML tag. It's the base unit of all HTML:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;tagname&gt;&lt;/tagname&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>That first half, <code>&lt;tagname&gt;</code>, between the first set of angle brackets, is called the <b>opening tag</b>. The second half, <code>&lt;/tagname&gt;</code>, between the second set of angle brackets, is called the <b>closing tag</b>. Note that the closing tag has a slash immediately after the first angle bracket. Anything between the opening and closing tag is said to be <i>inside</i> the tag. The text labeled <code>tagname</code> is said to be the name or type of the tag.</p>
            <h3>The HTML Template</h3>
            <p>Below is the starting template for virtually every web page in existence. It isn't strictly required, but you should still use it:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Let's break this down:</p>
            <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> - This tells the browser (and anything else reading the HTML file) that what you're looking at is, in fact, HTML. It's not exactly a "true" HTML tag.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;html&gt;</code> - All HTML goes in the <code>html</code> tag.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> - This is the <code>head</code> tag. You'll find "meta-information" about the web page here- for example, a description of the site that appears on search results, or a title that appears on the tab.</p>
            <p><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> - The <code>body</code> tag contains all the HTML on the web page that you can directly see.</p>
            <h3>Adding Content</h3>
            <p>Let's look at an example of some HTML that actually does something:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>The only real difference between this HTML and the template is the inclusion of the line <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;</code>, which represents a paragraph of text, where that text is "Hello World". Try typing out this example in JSFiddle. Once you run it, the result should resemble this (without the background, of course- that's just to differentiate the output from the rest of the page):</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <p>Hello World!</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Another Example</h3>
            <p>Here is an example with more tags:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;I am a header!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;I am a button!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>Its output:</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <h1 class="no-nav">I am a header!</h1>
                <p>I am a paragraph!</p>
                <button>I am a button!</button>
            </div>
            <p>As you may have guessed, the <code>h1</code> tag defines a header, and the <code>button</code> tag defines a button.</p>
            <h3>Some more tags</h3>
            <p>Here's an even more complex example:</p>
            <pre><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;I am a header!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;I am a (less important) header!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am a paragraph &lt;strong&gt;with bold text&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;I am a button!&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;input value="I am a text input!"&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
            <p>One odd thing you might immediately notice is that the <code>input</code> tag has no closing tag! This is no mistake- the input tag is supposed to work this way. You'll also notice that the opening tag has another unusual part- this <code>value="I am a text input!"</code> thing. This is an <b>HTML attribute</b>, a piece of data that modifies an HTML element. In this case, we're setting the <code>value</code> attribute to <code>I am a text input!</code> (remember to include quotes). For input elements, the <code>value</code> attribute represents the starting value within the input.</p>
            <p>Output:</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <h1 class="no-nav">I am a header!</h1>
                <h2 class="no-nav">I am a (less important) header!</h2>
                <p>I am a paragraph <strong>with bold text</strong>!</p>
                <button>I am a button!</button>
                <input value="I am a text input!">
            </div>
            <h3>Reverse-engineering HTML</h3>
            <p>Go to JSFiddle and create the HTML that produces the following output (do not worry if it looks slightly different- this page's CSS changes the font):</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <h1 class="no-nav">Header</h1>
                <p>text text <strong>text</strong> text text</p>
                <button>Click Me!</button>
            </div>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
<pre> <code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Header!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;text text &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt; text text&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;button&gt;Click Me!&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>More Reverse-Engineering</h3>
            <p>Here's a harder example. Consider the content in the purple box below. Try and replicate it using HTML:</p>
            <div class="html-output">
                <p>You can access Google Search by clicking <a href="https://google.com">here</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <p>You may realize that I did not tell you how to create a link. This is completely intentional- you will have to search up the solution yourself! Hint: It will involve a new HTML tag and a new HTML attribute. I recommend the site "W3Schools" for learning about this, though other sites work too.</p>
            <p>Solution:</p>
            <div class="spoiler">
                <input type="checkbox">
                <div>
<pre class="noborder"><code class="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can access Google Search by clicking &lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>                
            <p>Looking things up is probably the most important skill you can learn when programming, because, after a certain point, helping yourself will become far more efficient than getting help from someone else. After all, in many cases, you're the only one who knows how your code works!</p>
